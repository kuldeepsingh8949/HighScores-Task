# Math Question Generator

This project uses Python to generate **Word** and **PDF** files containing multiple-choice math questions in a structured format.  
The generated questions are inspired by base problems but adapted to new contexts while preserving the underlying math concepts.

## üìÇ Project Files
- `generate_questions.py` ‚Üí Python script that generates the questions in both `.docx` and `.pdf` formats.
- `Generated_Math_Questions.docx` ‚Üí Output Word file containing the generated questions.
- `Generated_Math_Questions.pdf` ‚Üí Output PDF file containing the generated questions.
- `README.md` ‚Üí This file.

## üìú Generated Questions
### 1. Pizza Topping Choices
