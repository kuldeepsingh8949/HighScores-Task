# Math Question Generator

This project uses Python to generate **Word** and **PDF** files containing multiple-choice math questions in a structured format.  
The generated questions are inspired by base problems but adapted to new contexts while preserving the underlying math concepts.

## üìÇ Project Files

### Core Scripts
- `generate_questions.py` ‚Üí Original script that generates 2 sample questions in both `.docx` and `.pdf` formats.
- `all_math_questions.py` ‚Üí Comprehensive script with 25 math questions (includes LaTeX formatting).
- `pdf_only_questions.py` ‚Üí Clean version that generates only PDF with 25 simplified math questions.
- `simple_math_questions.py` ‚Üí Minimal template file.

### Output Files
- `Generated_Math_Questions.docx` ‚Üí Original Word file with 2 sample questions.
- `Generated_Math_Questions.pdf` ‚Üí Original PDF file with 2 sample questions.
- `All_Math_Questions.pdf` ‚Üí Complete PDF with all 25 math questions.
- `README.md` ‚Üí This file.

## üìú Generated Questions

### Original Sample Questions (2)
1. **Pizza Topping Choices** - A combinatorics problem about calculating the total number of possible pizzas based on crust and topping options.

## üì¶ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install python-docx reportlab
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run This Project

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. This project works with Python 3.6+.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
First, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install python-docx reportlab
```

### Step 2: Choose Your Script

#### Option A: Generate 2 Sample Questions (Word + PDF)
```bash
python generate_questions.py
```
**Output**: Creates `Generated_Math_Questions.docx` and `Generated_Math_Questions.pdf`

#### Option B: Generate All 25 Questions (PDF Only)
```bash
python questions25.py
```
**Output**: Creates `All_Math_Questions.pdf` with comprehensive question set

### Step 3: Check Generated Files
After running either script, you'll find the generated files in your project directory:
- **Word documents**: `.docx` files
- **PDF files**: `.pdf` files

### Step 4: View Results
- **Word files**: Open with Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer, or any compatible word processor
- **PDF files**: Open with any PDF viewer (Adobe Reader, Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

### Troubleshooting
- **Import Error**: Make sure you've installed dependencies with `pip install python-docx reportlab`
- **Permission Error**: Ensure you have write permissions in the project directory
- **File Not Found**: Check that you're running the script from the project root directory
